# README - APU Zero Program Project Deliverables

## Overview
This document outlines the key project deliverables for the APU Zero program at Azul Linhas Aéreas. The program aims to reduce Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) usage during aircraft turnaround while maintaining flight punctuality.

## **Project Deliverables**

### **1. Suitability Analysis of Current Guidelines**
- Evaluate whether the existing APU Zero guidelines are effective for Minimum Ground Time (MGT) flights.
- Analyze the impact of the 5-minute wait time for external power connection upon aircraft arrival and the 5-minute APU activation before pushback.

### **2. Process Impact Assessment**
- Identify which processes or combination of processes have the greatest impact on flight punctuality.
- Examine dependencies between different turnaround activities, including refueling, marshalling, catering, and inspections.

### **3. Data-Driven Validation**
- Cross-analyze key indicators such as APU usage, turnaround time, and ground crew availability.
- Provide evidence-based recommendations for optimizing the APU Zero program.

### **4. Presentation of Findings**
- Develop a well-structured PowerPoint presentation summarizing the analysis, findings, and recommendations.
- Ensure clarity and conciseness to effectively communicate insights to stakeholders.
